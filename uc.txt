Unicode Standard

The Unicode Standard is a universal character encoding system designed to support the consistent representation and handling of text across all digital platforms and languages.

Developed and maintained by the Unicode Consortium, it includes over 140,000 characters covering more than 150 modern and historic scripts, as well as emoji and symbols.

Why It Matters:
- Ensures that text appears the same across different devices, operating systems, and applications.
- Enables multilingual content and communication.
- Provides a framework for emoji representation and development.

Encoding Formats:
- UTF-8: Most common encoding on the web. Backward-compatible with ASCII.
- UTF-16: Often used in operating systems and applications like Windows.
- UTF-32: Fixed-length encoding; easier for programming but uses more memory.

Where Itâ€™s Used:
- Websites and web browsers
- Mobile and desktop operating systems
- Databases and programming languages
- Messaging platforms and emoji systems

Benefits:
- Global interoperability
- Easier text processing and storage
- Reliable internationalization and localization
