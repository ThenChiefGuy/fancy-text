Typography Tips

Typography plays a crucial role in how users read, navigate, and perceive content on digital platforms. Good typography enhances readability, usability, and visual appeal.

1. Choose the Right Font:
- Use web-safe or licensed fonts.
- Sans-serif fonts (like Roboto or Open Sans) work best for screens.
- Avoid overly decorative fonts for body text.

2. Maintain Visual Hierarchy:
- Use different font sizes and weights for headings, subheadings, and body text.
- Bold or italicize sparingly to emphasize important points.

3. Ensure Readability:
- Use a font size of at least 16px for body text.
- Line height should be 1.4 to 1.6 times the font size.
- Maintain good contrast between text and background.

4. Limit Font Combinations:
- Stick to 1â€“2 fonts per project to keep design clean.
- Use one font for headings and another for body, or vary weight/style within one family.

5. Align Text Properly:
- Left-align body text for Western languages.
- Avoid center-aligning long paragraphs.

6. Responsive Typography:
- Use relative units like `em`, `rem`, or `%` for scalable text.
- Consider media queries to adjust typography on smaller screens.

7. Test Across Devices:
- Check how fonts render on different browsers and screen sizes.
- Avoid fonts that rely heavily on specific operating systems.

Good typography makes your content easier to consume and more enjoyable to read. Keep it simple, clean, and consistent.
